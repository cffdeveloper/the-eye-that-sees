/**
 * System-1 data collector — scheduled ingestion into raw_market_data.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE: Every industry/sub-flow gets 20-100+ dedicated data sources by
 * multiplying keyword queries across multiple platforms:
 *   • Google News RSS — per-country editions (45+ countries) × industry keywords
 *   • GDELT — industry-specific event queries
 *   • Reddit — industry-specific subreddits (5-30 per industry)
 *   • Twitter/X — industry keyword searches
 *   • YouTube — industry-specific channels
 *   • Specialized APIs — CoinGecko, forex, World Bank, etc.
 *   • Hacker News, Dev.to, GitHub — tech signals
 *
 * Each sub-flow's keywords are queried across ALL source platforms, giving
 * 20-100+ unique data source combinations per sub-category.
